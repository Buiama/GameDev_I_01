my shmup game


This is a 2D side-scrolling shmup mini-game where the player on behalf of a ship (red rectangle) wants to complete all three levels, destroying asteroids (round brownish objects) and enemy ships (white triangles) on his way. Enemy ships also shoot at the player, to survive he needs to either dodge these projectiles (orange crystals) or destroy them with his own.
There are two types of projectiles in the game: normal projectiles (green capsule) and freezing projectiles (blue capsule). Enemy bullets can be destroyed only by regular projectiles, it is logical, because freezing projectiles, firstly, do not cause any damage, and secondly, freezing projectile on the lore is a magical object in consistency like ice, so the enemy projectile, which flies at a fairly high speed, simply smashes the freezing projectile to pieces and flies on without loss of energy. 
If a normal projectile hits an enemy, he dies immediately.
When hitting the enemy with a freezing projectile, he freezes on the spot for 2 seconds, also his projectiles begin to fly slower and at a much shorter distance, because they do not have as much energy because of the frozen weapons of the enemy, so they are much sooner frozen in space and smashed to pieces.
Also, an item (yellow hexagon) can randomly appear on the map to stop time completely for 5 seconds. The player can only pick it up and then absolutely all objects except the player and his weapon freeze in place for the designated period.
A function for speeding up the character's movement has also been created
